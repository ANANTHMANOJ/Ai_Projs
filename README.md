# Projects and Research
This repository contains the amazing  projects and researchs of mine.
[](docs/)
 ### Prerequisites
 Knowlegde of Python and implementation of different libraries like torch,kivy and matplotlib will come to use in this project. Working with Python IDE such as Anaconda will make you confortable to code and execute it side by side.  
 ### Installing
 Open the Ananconda prompt and run the following codes in order to install some important libraries,
   
```
 conda install -c peterjc123 pytorch-cpu  
 conda install -c conda-forge kivy
 ```  
 
 ### Brief
 Execution of code will popup a window displaying a car with sensors (rectangle) moving automatically from source (right bottom) to destination (top left). We can draw a path for which the car understands the direction to take, the curves it should handle and drives from source to destination. The three buttons that you will find are used to clear the path drawn, save the learnt info of the car and load the information learnt respectively.


## [Product Recommendation Systems](Ananthmanoj_greatLearningProject7.ipynb)


This project involved building recommendation systems for Amazon products. A popularity-based model and a collaborative Filtering model were used and evaluated to recommend top-10 products for a user.

### Skills and Tools
Collaborative Filtering, Recommender Systems, Python

## Predicting the Strength of high performance concrete(Ananthmanoj_greatLearningProject7.ipynb)
This project involved feature exploration and selection to predict the strength of high-performance concrete. Used Regression models like Decision tree regressors to find out the most important features and predict the strength. Cross-validation techniques and Grid search were used to tune the parameters for best model performance.

### Skills and Tools
Regression, Decision trees, feature engineering

## Classifying silhouettes of vehicles(Ananthmanoj_greatLearningProject7.ipynb)
Classified vehicles into different types based on silhouettes which may be viewed from many angles. Used PCA in order to reduce dimensionality and SVM for classification

### Skills and Tools
Support Vector Machines, Principal Component Analysis, Classification

## Predicting the term-deposit subscription(Ananthmanoj_greatLearningProject7.ipynb)
Leveraged customer information of bank marketing campaigns to predict whether a customer will subscribe to term deposit or not. Different classification algorithms like Decision tree, Logistic Regression were used. Ensemble techniques like Random forest were used to further improve the classification results.

### Skills and Tools
Classification, Decision Trees, Ensemble Techniques

## Identifying potential customers for loans(Ananthmanoj_greatLearningProject7.ipynb)
Identified potential loan customers for Thera Bank using classification techniques. Compared models built with Logistic Regression and KNN algorithm in order to select the best performing one.

### Skills and Tools
Logistic Regression, KNN, Classification

## Health Insurance(Ananthmanoj_greatLearningProject7.ipynb)
This project used Hypothesis Testing and Visualization to leverage customer's health information like smoking habits, bmi, age, and gender for checking statistical evidence to make valuable decisions of insurance business like charges for health insurance.

### Skills and Tools
Hypothesis Testing, Data visualisation, statistical Inference
